xdg-desktop-portal (1.20.0+ds-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/rules: Only enable as-installed tests if we're building that package
  * d/rules: Enable tests whenever we are building as-installed tests.
    Even if we will not actually run the tests at build-time, we still
    need to enable the option if we want to install the as-installed
    tests, and for that we need a subset of the tests' dependencies.

  * New upstream development release

  * d/x-d-p.docs: NEWS is now named NEWS.md
  * d/rules: Rename the pytest option to tests, following upstream
  * d/control: Explicitly build-depend on python3-dbus.
    It's used by dbusmock, and the upstream build system checks for it.

    d/p/tests-Assert-that-markup-body-text-is-escaped-correctly.patch:
    Add patches from upstream to fix handling of XML in notifications
  * Release to unstable (Closes: #1095098).
    While this is still a development release, upstream intends to
    release 1.20.x in time for the Debian 13 freeze, so it's better to
    have wider testing at this stage.

    slow, and there is no official way to tell which architectures
    do this.
