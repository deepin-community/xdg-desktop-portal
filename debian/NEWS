xdg-desktop-portal (1.17.1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  Since xdg-desktop-portal 1.17.0, portal implementation backends are
  selected with a new mechanism documented in portals.conf(5).
  Each desktop environment should provide a file at
  /usr/share/xdg-desktop-portal/${DESKTOP}-portals.conf listing the
  preferred portal implementations to be used in that desktop environment.

  System administrators and users can override this via files named
  portals.conf or ${DESKTOP}-portals.conf in /etc/xdg-desktop-portal
  or ~/.config/xdg-desktop-portal, and users of customized or otherwise
  unsupported desktop environments should also use this mechanism to set
  up their preferred portals. Please see portals.conf(5) for full details.

  ${DESKTOP} is the desktop environment's entry in $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP
  (also seen in DesktopNames in /usr/share/{x,wayland-}sessions/*.desktop),
  with ASCII upper case transformed to lower case. For example,
  the budgie-desktop package sets XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Budgie:GNOME,
  so Budgie sessions will use budgie-portals.conf if provided, or fall
  back to GNOME's gnome-portals.conf if not.
